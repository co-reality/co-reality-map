Before you create this issue, search for duplicate issues [here](https://github.com/sparkletown/internal-sparkle-issues/) - add to that issue if appropriate. Make sure to also check closed issues.

**If it's not in issues, continue**:

1. **Titles** should be in the format â€œAs a [type of user] I want [my goal] so that [my reason]" instead of the solution 
2. **Label** the issue (see [here](https://github.com/sparkletown/internal-sparkle-issues/labels) for label explanations)

### Fill out the following sections

1. **Due date** - only add if critical, use YY/MM/DD format, include time with time zone if necessary: 
2. **Description** (use formatting like bold/italics to help us read better; and write in as much detail as possible)

3. **@someone** - if someone else involved or should know about this, mention them here: 
4. **Link** - paste the link to the venue that this should be added to if relevant: 

- [ ]  **Confirm this only contains one feature** - if you have multiple features you would like to implement, you can create an issue with a list of all the features, and then create individual issues for each feature and link them on the feature list issue.
