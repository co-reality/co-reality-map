### Launch application

You're going to need 2 terminal tabs to launch Sparkle application locally. Make sure that you're located in the application root folder and follow steps below:
* Run `npm run firebase:emulate-functions` in the first tab
* Run `npm run start` in the second

Once the launch is complete you may proceed to http://localhost:3000/v/bootstrap
