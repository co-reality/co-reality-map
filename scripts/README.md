# Scripts: Scripts for variosu Sparkly things

Most scripts have usage instructions.

However some of these scripts require a file called `prodAccountKey.json`.

To obtain this file, go to Firebase and follow these steps:

1. Go to Project Settings
2. Go to Service Accounts
3. Click `Generate new private key`
4. Save the key
5. Move it to `scripts/prodAccountKey.json`

WARNING - this file grants passwordless access to ALL data in Firebase including delete access. Treat the file like a private key and keep it safe.
